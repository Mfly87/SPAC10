### Assignment

The goal of this assigment was to add some final polish to previous assignments.
This project tries to combine a bit of everything by creating an SQL database of fictive books as well as a user friendly app to search the database in a web browser.

Due to the assigment being shorter than expected a lot of the data classes have been set up to make it easy to auto generate SQL tables. The intent was to figure out what type of data that would be interesting to browse afterwards, but in its current state the extra complexity was unnessesary.

An attempt has been made to make the generated data a bit more interesting to browse through, which also adds some complexity to how it is being generated.

NOTE: Everything is run locally.
